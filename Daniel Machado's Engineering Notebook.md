Entry 10/24/2024 - This is my first entry to the notebook, so I will give a quick overview of what we have done so far with the project. The first week we met with John (our product owner) for about an hour at the union, and he explained to us the whole project, his idea of how the project should go about, and answered any questions that we might have. 

From then, we decided to start by learning more about Neural Networks, and to try and get everyone in our group in the same page, as there were some people that knew about neural networks and others that didn't. We were researching about theory to understand what we are working with, and researching about the framework we are going to be using, Pytorch. 

Once the project started, we were still researching about this, and we decided to meet with John on Tuesdays. We started the project a bit disorganized but we are getting it together.

I started working on the generation of Neural Networks based on user inputs. However, last week we spoke with John and noticed we were having a very different approach than what he wanted. I spent this whole sprint fixing our wrong approach, and finishing up the creation of the networks. 

So far, my part can: accept user inputs for the architecture and parameters, generate networks, save networks, train networks, and save them based on some success criteria. I still have to finish up and clean my code for better readability and understanding, but the main part is done. I also need to add later on support for GPU training and training in parallel.
