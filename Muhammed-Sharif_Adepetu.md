-	Planned Creating Functions for visually assessing the loss of the nerual networks
-	Made simple loss graph with data from single nerual network

# 10/22/2024
- Found out i wrote function in the wrong branch so i had to create new branch to test the loss function graphs
- I'll have to run this graphing function for each nerual network in the file. each network will have their own seperate line on the same graph
- The approach i think i will take is to have all the networks in an array track the loss for each network

- I have to figure out what Jhon would consider the success criteria. riht now i will jsut track the loss over the first 100 iterations
- Will change the criteria for stopping the tracking once we figure out how much we want to change
- forgot to take notes before this class so wrote down as much as i remember from the past few weeks in the engineering notebook branch
